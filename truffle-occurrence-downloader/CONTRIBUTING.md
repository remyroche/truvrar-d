## üìù Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

### üêõ Bug Reports
- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Include a clear description of the bug
- Provide steps to reproduce
- Include system information (OS, Python version, etc.)

- Consider if it fits the project's scope

### üîß Code Contributions
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Test improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the existing code style

### 3. Run Tests and Linting
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=truffle_downloader

# Check code style
black --check src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of changes"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `Add:` for new features
- `Fix:` for bug fixes
- `Update:` for improvements
- `Remove:` for deletions
- `Docs:` for documentation changes

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples in docstrings
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add docstrings for new functions/classes

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_downloader.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=truffle_downloader --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Mock external API calls
- Use fixtures for common test data

### Example Test Structure
```python
def test_function_name_success():
    """Test successful case"""
    # Arrange
    input_data = "test"
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output

def test_function_name_error():
    """Test error case"""
    # Arrange
    invalid_input = None
    
    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        function_under_test(invalid_input)
```

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints
- Document parameters and return values
- Include usage examples

### Example Docstring
```python
def download_species(self, species: List[str], **kwargs) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Download occurrence data for specified truffle species.
    
    Args:
        species: List of species names to download
        **kwargs: Additional filtering parameters
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame with occurrence records
        
    Example:
        >>> downloader = GBIFTruffleDownloader()
        >>> data = downloader.download_species(["Tuber melanosporum"])
        >>> print(len(data))
        150
    """
```
